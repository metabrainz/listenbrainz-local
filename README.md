# listenbrainz-local

ListenBrainz local brings recommendation features to your local Subsonic hosted music collection. Many subsonic projects
lack recommendations or good playlisting tools and this project aims to create another layer on top of these projects to show
what can actually be done when you have lots of good music metadata. 

Note: Your collection must be tagged with MBIDs in order for this project to work.

Support for LB Radio and Weekly jams exists now -- music playback and saving playlists to the subsonic hosts are now working and many other recommendation tools will be added over time. 

This project is a web app that requires a subsonic hosted music collection. Projects that we've tested with
include:

* [Funkwhale](https://www.funkwhale.audio/)
* [Gonic](https://github.com/sentriz/gonic)
* [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/)

# Installation

We're not quite ready for others to start playing with this project yet, it is under active development! But soon we will have a baseline of features working where we can invite others to come play.
